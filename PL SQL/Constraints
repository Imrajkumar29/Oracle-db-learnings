Data Integrity -> The data stored in oracle db should follow certain business rules. 
      eg :reg no - has to be unique 
      Gender -> should have either male or Female value only
      Date of joining -> should be lesser than the current system date.
      
Ways to ensure Data Integrity 
  Enforcing business rules with triggered stored database proedures
  Enforcing the business rules in the code of a database application.(i.e making validations in the application UI when the data is entered).
  Oracle Database integrity constraints which are rules defined at the column or object level that restrict values in the database.
  Using stored procedures to completely control access to data.
  
Integrity Contraint - a rule that restricts the values in a database. 
Use a contraint to define an integrity constraint.

Constraints -> Validate the data for business rules before getting stored into the table.
        Constraints are created as part of the table definition itself.
        The rules are centralized. The data entered by all applications has to adhere to the same integrity constraints.
        Flexibilty . integrity constraints can be disabled and enabled.
                      integrity constraints can be disabled temmporarily to avoid performance overhead when loading large amounts of data.

Types of Contraints- NOT NULL, Unique Key, Primary Key, Foreign Key, Check, REF

NOT NULL - prohibits a column from having null values.

eg : create table emp(empno number, 
      ename varchar2(100) null, 
      address1 varchar2(100) constraint address_not_null not null, 
      address2 varchar2(100) not null,
      address2 varchar3(100)
      );
by default there will be null constraint.Even if null is explicitly mentioned , it will not be in the meta data information.
In the above eg address_not_null is the name of the constraint which is optional. 
address2 will get created with system defined constraint name.

meta data information
      select * from user_constraints where table_name ='EMP';
      select * from user_cons_columns where table_name ='EMP'
Disabling a constraint -> alter table emp disable constraint address_not_null_cons;
      By default the constraint will be created with the enable mode, if we want to create it with disable mode see the below eg:
      eg: address1 varchar2(100) constraint address_not_null not null disable, 
Drop a constraint-> Alter table emp drop constraint address_not_null;
