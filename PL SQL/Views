Views - Presents data from the underlying table.Views display the same data in multiple ways.
View do not hold any data of its own. Views are metadata only objects(or can be said as named queries).
View will execute the query and fetch the underlying information from the base table.
It is a logical table created on top of the base table.
Create or  Replace force View emp_10 as select * from emp where deptno=10;
force - If we want to create a view first before the base table is created. But This can be used only when the base table is created.
Select * from user_views; -> to check the list of views created by the user
select * from user_tab_columns where table_name ='EMP_SAL_VIEW' -> to check the column details of a view.
Advantage:
1. Can create any number of views as it is not going to take space.As it is not going to store the data of the base table.
2. Display the same data in multiple ways.
3. Hide unwanted records from other users.
