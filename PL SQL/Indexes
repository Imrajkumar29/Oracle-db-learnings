What is index? 
    Index helps to access data from the database in a faster and easier manner. 
    Index is a schema object that contains entry of each value of the indexd columns of the table and provides direct,fast access to rows.
    Index will take the rowid and access the table data.
    rowid - easiest way to indetify a record in a table. Physical address of where a particular row is located in the database.
    Hexadecimal number which gives information about the dat file, segment,which extent this row is stored.
 
 How to create index? (select * from  emp_t);
     B-Tree Index-> create index idx1_btree1_empno on emp_t(empno); created on column where data is widely distributed.
     Bitmap Index-> create bitmap index idx2_bitmap_deptno on emp_t(deptno); created on column with lesser distinct values. like dept no has only 3 distinct values
     and they get repeated.eg: gender, pass or fail , yes or no type of values.
     function Based Index->create index idx3_fn_ename on emp_t(upper(ename))
     reverse key index-> create index idx4_revkey_sal on emp_t(sal) reverse -> to avoid index block contention reverse key index is used.
     composite index -> create index idx5_comp_idx on emp_t(job,deptno)
     
 Where to check metadata info about indexes? -> name of the index , table name on which index is created, type of index.
      user_indexes 
      user_ind_columns->select * from user_ind_columns where table_name ='EMP_T';
      user_ind_statistics->select * from user_ind_statistics where table_name ='EMP_T';
      user_ind_expressions->select * from user_ind_expressions where table_name ='EMP_T'; for function based index.
    
 What are the types of Index?
     1. B-Tree Index.->Index organised tables, Reverse Key indexes, Descending indexes, B-Tree Cluster indexes.
     2. Bitmap and bitmap join indexes.->
     3. function Based Indexes.
