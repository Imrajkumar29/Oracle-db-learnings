What is index? 
    Index helps to access data from the database in a faster and easier manner. 
    Index is a schema object that contains entry of each value of the indexd columns of the table and provides direct,fast access to rows.
    Index will take the rowid and access the table data.
    rowid - easiest way to indetify a record in a table. Physical address of where a particular row is located in the database.
    Hexadecimal number which gives information about the dat file, segment,which extent this row is stored.
 
 How to create index? (select * from  emp_t);
     B-Tree Index-> create index idx1_btree1_empno on emp_t(empno); created on column where data is widely distributed.
     Bitmap Index-> create bitmap index idx2_bitmap_deptno on emp_t(deptno); created on column with lesser distinct values. like dept no has only 3 distinct values
     and they get repeated.eg: gender, pass or fail , yes or no type of values.
     function Based Index->create index idx3_fn_ename on emp_t(upper(ename))
     reverse key index-> create index idx4_revkey_sal on emp_t(sal) reverse -> to avoid index block contention reverse key index is used.
     composite index -> create index idx5_comp_idx on emp_t(job,deptno)
     
 Where to check metadata info about indexes? -> name of the index , table name on which index is created, type of index.
      user_indexes 
      user_ind_columns->select * from user_ind_columns where table_name ='EMP_T';
      user_ind_statistics->select * from user_ind_statistics where table_name ='EMP_T';
      user_ind_expressions->select * from user_ind_expressions where table_name ='EMP_T'; for function based index.
    
 What are the types of Index?
     1. B-Tree Index.->Index organised tables, Reverse Key indexes, Descending indexes, B-Tree Cluster indexes.
     2. Bitmap and bitmap join indexes.->
     3. function Based Indexes.
     
B-Tree Index
What is B-tree index ? How index data is stored?
       stands for Balanced trees. B-Tree index is an ordered list of values divided into ranges along with
       the rowid information stored in the index segment. access the records in the table with the help of rowid.
       eg: create index idx_empno on emp_tab(empno);
       
       when the following query is run ,select * from employee where emp_id =5 . Oracle optimizer, Through meta data information identifies the index details.
       Starts the search from index root map, searches all the records with 5 and goes to the particular record
       Though it identifies the first instance of 5 , it continues the search till all instances of 5 are found (in case the column is non unique).       
        
Where to find the metadata information?
      user_indexes -> select * from user_indexes where table_name ='EMP_T';
      user_ind_columns->select * from user_ind_columns where table_name ='EMP_T';
      user_ind_statistics->select * from user_ind_statistics where table_name ='EMP_T';
      user_ind_expressions->select * from user_ind_expressions where table_name ='EMP_T';
      
How to find whether  index is used by the query?
      By running the explain plan -> In table access-> index , object_name -> index name 
      Once the query is run -> select * fromv$sql where sql_text like '%from emp where empno=5%'--> will give sql_id
      select sql_id, operation,options, object_name,object_type, cost,cardinlaity from v$sql_plan where sql_id ='' use sql_id from previous query.
      Another way -> monitoring the index
      
When to create B-tree index?
      B-Tree index are suitable for columns containing high number of unique values. eG: account number, student reg number, employee id
      Cardinality-> the ratio of distinct values to the number of table tows. A column with only two distinct values in a million row table would have low cardinality.
      When cardinality is high , B-tree is recommended else Bitmap is recommended.

What types of scan operations B-tree index will do?
       Range scan- searches for a range of values . can be seen in explain plan.
       Unique scan- to perform unique scan create an unique index. moment it finds the first key value goes through the execution and returns the record.
                    unique scan is faster compared to range scan.
       Full scan - full scan of the index data. 
                    eg: create index idx_sal on emp(sal);/select sum(sal) from emp;       
       Full scan(min/max) - eg : create index idx_sal on emp(sal);/select sum(sal) from emp;
       Fast Full scan - create index idx_sal on emp(sal);/create index idx_empno on emp(empno); ->select empno,sal from emp;
                        retrieves the data from two indexes ,combines and returns the output.
                        
Note:Oracle will not index the null values. 

Can we create index for all columns?
        not recommended .will slower the performance as we are duplicating the entire table once again. 
        Instead can create and index organised table.Data is stored in the table in the sorted order itself.

What are the advantages/disadvantages of B-tree index?
        improves the performance.
        dml statement performance wil degrade. when dml operation is performed, oracle has to manage the index also.
        everytime a insert is performed oracle has to rearrange the data.


Bitmap Index
        In a bitmap index, the database stores a bitmap for each index key. In a conventional B-tree index, one index entry points to a single row. 
        In a bitmap index, each index key stores pointers to multiple rows.
        Bitmap indexes are primarily designed for data warehousing or environments in which queries reference many columns in an ad hoc fashion.
        Situations that may call for a bitmap index include:
        The indexed columns have low cardinality, that is, the number of distinct values is small compared to the number of table rows.
        eg :gender, status , etc which will have lesser distinct values.
        The indexed table is either read-only or not subject to significant modification by DML statements.
        Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a possible rowid. If the bit is set, then the row with the corresponding rowid contains the key value.
        A mapping function converts the bit position to an actual rowid, so the bitmap index provides the same functionality as a B-tree index 
        although it uses a different internal representation.
        Eg:
        Value Row1 Row2 Row3 Row4 Row5 Row6 Row7
        M      1    0   1     1    1    0    0
        F      0    1   0     0    0    1    1
        
        A mapping function converts each bit in the bitmap to a rowid of the customers table. 
        Each bit value depends on the values of the corresponding row in the table.
        For example, the bitmap for the M value contains a 1 as its first bit because the gender is M in the first row of the customers table.
        The bitmap cust_gender='M' has a 0 for its the bits in rows 2, 6, and 7 because these rows do not contain M as their value.

Bitmap index Issue with DML operations
        If the indexed column in a single row is updated, then the database locks the index key entry (for example, M or F)
        and not the individual bit mapped to the updated row. Because a key points to many rows,
        DML on indexed data typically locks all of these rows. For this reason, bitmap indexes are not appropriate for many OLTP applications.


Explain Function Based Index?
         A function-based index computes the value of a function or expression involving one or more columns and stores it in the index. 
         A function-based index can be either a B-tree or a bitmap index. 
         The function used for building the index can be an arithmetic expression or an expression that contains a SQL function,
         user-defined PL/SQL function, package function, or C callout.
         The optimizer can use an index range scan on a function-based index for queries with expressions in WHERE clause.
 
 For example, suppose you create the following function-based index:

        CREATE INDEX emp_total_sal_idx
          ON employees (12 * salary * commission_pct, salary, commission_pct);

        The database can use the preceding index when processing queries below:
        SELECT   employee_id, last_name, first_name, 
                 12*salary*commission_pct AS "ANNUAL SAL"
        FROM     employees
        WHERE    (12 * salary * commission_pct) < 30000
        ORDER BY "ANNUAL SAL" DESC;

        CREATE INDEX emp_fname_uppercase_idx 
        ON employees ( UPPER(first_name) ); 

        SELECT * 
        FROM   employees
        WHERE  UPPER(first_name) = 'AUDREY'; 

Uses of Function-Based Indexes
        Function-based indexes are efficient for evaluating statements that contain functions in their WHERE clauses. 
        The database only uses the function-based index when the function is included in a query. 
        When the database processes INSERT and UPDATE statements, however, it must still evaluate the function to process the statement.

      A function-based index is also useful for indexing only specific rows in a table. For example, the cust_valid column in the sh.
        customers table has either I or A as a value. To index only the A rows, you could write a function that returns
        a null value for any rows other than the A rows. You could create the index as follows:

        CREATE INDEX cust_valid_idx
        ON customers ( CASE cust_valid WHEN 'A' THEN 'A' END );
        
Reverse Key Index
This is used to resolve the index block contention.
The key column values are reversed and stored in the index segment.
when we query a table with reverse key index  it will go for a full table scan as the key column values are not in the sorted under unlike a btree index.

When to choose what type of index?
    B-Tree indexes are suitable for columns containing high number of unique values. eg : account no, reg no.
    Bitmap index are suitable for table with low cardinality value. 
    Function based indexes are mainly used whenever the functions are used with columns or an expression is frequently used in where condition.
    Reverse key index is mainly used to avoid the index block contention.

How to know index is being used:
 Check the explain plan. But explain plan will show the estimated plan. The plan that oracle is going to execute.
 Actual plan can be obtained from the underlying data dictionary tables
 Step1 : select * from v$sql where sql_text like 'from emp where empno=5%'; get the sql_id 
 Step2 : select sql_id , operation, options, object_name, object_type, cost,cardinality from v$sql_plan where sql_id ='g5hutuqd';
 v$sql_plan - is the actual explain plan
 
How to Monitor index usage
Step1 : Alter index Idx_EMPNO MONITORING USAGE; - will mark index for monitoring
step2 : select * from emp where empno =7788; running the query which uses the index(run the application).
step3 : Alter index Idx_EMPNO NOMONITORING USAGE;

In case the index is being used it will be captured in dba_object_usage table. 
select * from dba_object_usage; - will show if index is used/not. alternate old table ->v$object_usage


Benefits/Drawbacks of Index
Benefits -> Perfomance improvement
Drawbacks-> consumes considerable amount of space, DML performance might get impacted, index needs to be managed.
