Dynamic SQL

Static SQL->Any sql statement which does not change during the runtime and remains fixed.
	    Advantage : Already know if all the dependent objects are available while writing the statement.
			These statements are hardcoded into our application, thus can be tuned for optimal performance.

Native Dynamic SQL-> Any sql statement which is constructed at the runtime is called dynamic SQL.
Dynamic SQL Gives Flexibility as it constructed on runtime, whereas static sql lets you execute only DML statements inside your PL/SQL block.

Eg: Dynamic sql can be used to create a table, drop an index or truncate a table inside the PLSQL block.

PL SQL statements also can be constructed dynamically.

How do we use dynamic sql ?
1. Execute immediate statement and 
2. Open-For ,Fetch & Close block.
3. Bulk Fetch, Bulk Execute Immediate, Bulk Forall, Bulk Collect into statement.

Execute Immediate -> Using this we can parse and execute any SQL statement or PL/SQL Block dynamically in oracle database.
		     Best suited for those SQL statements which returns single row of results.

Syntax:
	EXECUTE IMMEDIATE dynamic_query
	[INTO user_defined_variable-1, user_defined_variable-2…] -> optional
	[USING bind_argument-1, bind_argument-2…] -> optional 
	[RETURNING|RETURN-INTO clause];  

dynamic_query-> This query could be a SQL statement or a PL/SQL block. Moreover the compiler treats the dynamic query as a string of VARCHAR2 data type.
USING clause-> if bind variable is speicified in your dynamic query then this clause helps you specify values for it which will be taken during runtime.
RETURNING or RETURN INTO clause-> Return into clause is opposite to the USING clause. Whereas in using clause we supply the values to the dynamic query
				 here in RETURNING INTO clause we get the values returned by the dynamic query. And store them into the specified list 
				 of bind arguments. Again it is an Optional Clause.


DML Select statement using execute immediate :
	Declare 
	sql_qry varchar(150);
	emp_tot number(3);
	BEGIN
	sql_qry:='SELECT count(*) from employees';
	Execute Immediate sql_qry into emp_tot;
	dbms_output.put_line('Total Employees are :'||emp_tot);
	end;
/

DDL Statement using execute immediate
	BEGIN
	    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE TABLE tut_82(
				tut_num     NUMBER(3),
				tut_name    VARCHAR2(50)
			)';
	END;
/

Another Version of DDL Statement
	SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
	DECLARE
	    ddl_qry     VARCHAR2(150);
	BEGIN
	ddl_qry := 'CREATE TABLE tut_83('||
			'tut_num     NUMBER(3),'||
			'tut_name    VARCHAR2(50)'||
			')';
	EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ddl_qry;
END;
/

Alter table using execute immediate
	SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
	DECLARE
	 ddl_qry VARCHAR2(50);
	BEGIN
	 ddl_qry := 'ALTER TABLE tut_83
			 ADD  tut_date DATE';
	 EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ddl_qry;
	END;
/  

Drop table using execute immediate
	SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
	DECLARE
	    ddl_qry     VARCHAR2 (100);
	BEGIN
	    ddl_qry := 'DROP TABLE tut_83';
	    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ddl_qry;
	END;

Insert DML With Bind Variable: Why?
	The two biggest advantages of bind variables are security against SQL injections and performance enhancement by reducing hard parsing.

What is this Using Clause of Execute Immediate statement?
	In static SQL we had to specify the value for bind variable after execution of the PL/SQL program. 
	While in Dynamic SQL we have to mention the values beforehand for all the bind variables. 
	Therefore, to specify the values for all the bind variables we take the help of USING clause of Execute Immediate Statement.
	By applying ‘USING’ clause we list down all the values for every bind variable used in the SQL statement that we desire to execute dynamically.

Eg:
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    sql_smt VARCHAR2 (150);
BEGIN
    sql_smt :=  'INSERT INTO stu_info (student_name) VALUES (:stu_name)';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_smt USING 'Steve';
    commit;
END;
/
The value you are assigning to your bind variable through the USING clause must either be the same or compatible 
with the data type of the column of the table into which you are inserting it.

Multiple bind variables in Execute immediate statement
Eg:
	Set Serveroutput On;
	Declare
	    Sql_Smt Varchar2(150);
	Begin
	    Sql_Smt := 'UPDATE stu_info SET student_name = :new_name 
	    WHERE student_name = :old_name ';
	    Execute Immediate Sql_Smt Using 'Strange','Leo';   
	End;

Important 
	In native dynamic SQL we need to list down the values for all the bind variables used in the SQL query beforehand.
	You cannot use schema object names such as table name as bind argument in native dynamic SQL.
	Data type of bind argument should either match or be compatible with the datatype of its corresponding context.
	The order of values in the list of USING clause must match with that of the bind variables in the query.




### 4. **`RETURNING INTO` Clause (For DML statements)**:
The `RETURNING INTO` clause is used when executing `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements that include a `RETURNING` clause. This allows you to retrieve values from the modified rows.

#### Example (`RETURNING INTO` Clause):
```sql
DECLARE
  v_emp_name VARCHAR2(100);
  v_emp_id NUMBER;
BEGIN
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary)
                    VALUES (employees_seq.NEXTVAL, ''John'', ''Doe'', 60000)
                    RETURNING employee_id, first_name INTO :emp_id, :emp_name'
  RETURNING INTO v_emp_id, v_emp_name;

  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('New Employee ID: ' || v_emp_id);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('New Employee Name: ' || v_emp_name);
END;
/
```
Statement processed.
New Employee ID: 23
New Employee Name: John

- The `RETURNING INTO` clause is used to fetch the newly inserted `employee_id` and `first_name` values after the `INSERT` statement is executed.

### 5. **Combining `USING` and `RETURNING INTO` Clauses**:
You can combine both the `USING` and `RETURNING INTO` clauses in one `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement.

#### Example (Using `USING` and `RETURNING INTO` Together):
```sql
DECLARE
  v_new_salary NUMBER := 75000;
  v_emp_name VARCHAR2(100);
  v_emp_id NUMBER := 101;
BEGIN
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'UPDATE employees SET salary = :new_salary WHERE employee_id = :emp_id
                    RETURNING first_name INTO :emp_name'
  USING v_new_salary, v_emp_id
  RETURNING INTO v_emp_name;

  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Updated Employee Name: ' || v_emp_name);
END;
/

### 7. **Using Bind Variables in Dynamic PL/SQL Blocks**:
In addition to SQL statements, you can dynamically execute PL/SQL blocks using `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`.

#### Example (Dynamic PL/SQL Block):
```sql
DECLARE
  v_salary_increase NUMBER := 5000;
BEGIN
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'BEGIN
                      UPDATE employees SET salary = salary + :sal_increase WHERE department_id = 10;
                    END;'
  USING v_salary_increase;
END;
/
```

Using execute immediagte with bulk collect clause
/
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_coll IS TABLE OF employees%rowtype;
    emp_records emp_coll;
    sql_qry VARCHAR2(150);
BEGIN
    sql_qry := 'SELECT * FROM employees';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_qry BULK COLLECT INTO emp_records;
    FOR idx IN emp_records.first..emp_records.COUNT
        LOOP
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(idx||' - '||emp_records(idx).first_name);
        END LOOP;
END;
/
