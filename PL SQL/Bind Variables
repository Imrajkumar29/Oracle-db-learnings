Bind variables in Oracle database can be defined as the variables that we create in SQL* PLUS and then reference in PL/SQL. 

Unlike user variables which can only be declared inside the declaration section of PL/SQL block you can declare bind variable
anywhere in the host environment and that is the reason why we also refer bind variables as host variable.

Variable command declares the bind variable which you can refer in PL/SQL.
eg: VARIABLE v_bind1 VARCHAR2 (10);
notice that I didn’t write any PL/SQL block or section here to declare this bind variable which is very unlike the user variable.

To display the list of all the bind variables you simply have to write the keyword variable and execute. 
eg :VARIABLE;

To see the definition of the bind variable you have to write the keyword VARIABLE followed by the name of the bind variable in question
eg: Variable v_bind2;

Restriction:
If you are creating a bind variable of NUMBER datatype then you can not specify the precision and scale.

Initializing the Bind Variable
 1. using “Execute” command. -> Exec :v_bind1   := ‘Rebellion Rider’;
 2. Initialize the bind variable by explicitly writing execution section of PL/SQL block.
 Eg:
BEGIN
:v_bind1 := ‘Manish Sharma’;
END;
/

bind variables are referenced using colon (:v_bind1)

Displaying the bind variable
There are 3 ways of displaying the value held by bind variable in PL/SQL or say in Oracle Database.
1.Using DBMS OUTPUT package.
 eg: 
    BEGIN
    :v_bind1 := ‘RebellionRider’;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(:v_bind1);
    END;
2.Using Print command.
Print :v_bind1;
Or
Print v_bind1;

3. Setting Auto print parameter on
