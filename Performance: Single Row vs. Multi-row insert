Performance: Single Row vs. Multi-row
In general it's better to combine SQL commands into as few statements as possible. This will give the best performance.

For example, the following compares the performance of single-row vs multi-row inserts. Both add 50,000 rows. Single-row adds one row 50,000 times. Multi-row adds 50,000 rows in one go. The multi-row version will be 10x to 100x faster!

declare
  start_time   pls_integer;
  insert_count pls_integer := 50000;
begin
  start_time := dbms_utility.get_time ();
  
  for i in 1 .. insert_count loop
    insert into bricks 
    values ( i, 'red', 'cube' );
  end loop;
  
  dbms_output.put_line ( 'Single-row duration = ' || ( dbms_utility.get_time () - start_time) );
  
  rollback;
  
  start_time := dbms_utility.get_time ();
  
  insert into bricks
    select level, 'red', 'cube' from dual
    connect by level <= insert_count;
  
  dbms_output.put_line ( 'Multi-row duration = ' || ( dbms_utility.get_time () - start_time) );
  
  rollback;
end;
/
So use multi-row inserts where you can!
