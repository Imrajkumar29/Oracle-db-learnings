1. Decode can perform only equality check. Case can perform equals , not equal , > , < check , can have AND, or
and efficient work like a if then else block. i.e case can work with logical operator.
2. Decode does not expect datatype consistence whereas case expects datatype consistency. 
3. Decode is a function and case is a statement. decode can be only used with sql queries and 
it cannot used with pl constructs directly used to work with variables.
4. case when salary in/bewteen (subquery can be used here). this cannot be done with decode.
5. case can used when passing as a parameter between functions and procedures.
6. case and decode handle null differently . decode is one place in oracle where NULL=NULL works.
